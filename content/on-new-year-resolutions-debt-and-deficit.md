In a previous post I talked, somewhat against the norm, of forming new year resolutions at the end of January. I have been thinking about those resolutions for quite a while now and have finally decided what I have wanted to do, only a mere 6 months late.

## The past 6 months, trials tribulations and learning outcomes
* some truths about the facts
* consultancy etc
* learning how to business
* seeing quite a few things in terms of deficit

## Your new year can start any day you like
* mike vardy's groundhog day

## every problem looks like a nail
It is often said that "if all you have is a hammer every problem starts to look like a nail" while that is generally peddled out as a negative example I believe that sometimes it can be quite useful

* high complexity can benefit from overly simple models
* a model does not always need to be complete if it is useful

## Name your debt crises
* overweight
* actual monetary debts
* organisational debts
 * no experience running a business - advice from my wife to work for somone else
 * consultency implosion - see last post
* relationship debt
 * friends
 * family
 * new contacts

## Pick three and measure
* the power of threes
* hard to say what is most important
* in my new years post i talked about measurements, snap to it

## three debts and one goal
the one goal that I wanted to achieve is to sell something, anything
